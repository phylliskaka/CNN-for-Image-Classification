# ResNet50-for-image-recognition
The goal of this project is to implement a 50 layers Neural network with skip connection to do classification for image

## Dataset


## Function need to implement before building ResNet50 model
#load_dataset()
#convert_to_one_hot_vector()
#convolution_block()
#identity_block
